    "Customized Logging in Python:\n",
    "In python, the logging module has mainly four components: loggers, handlers, filters and formatters. Loggers are the objects of the logging module with which we handle the logging functionality. Handlers are those which specify where the logging should go to i.e console or files etc. Filters are those with which we can tell the logger what logs to record i.e levels of logging. Formatters are those which are used to customize the log messages.\n",
